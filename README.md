# AVIATOR

The AVIATOR (A Vienna Inverse-Abel-Transform-based Object Reconstruction) algorithm estimates 3D density distributions from their 2D projections based on a set of intuitive assumptions about the 3D geometry of structures. For a detailed description of the algorithm, take a look at the corresponding Astronomy & Astrophysics publication.

This repository contains a Python implementation of the AVIATOR algorithm and a notebook illustrating the use of the algorithm. For questions about the algorithm, consult the A&A paper or contact the authors. If the algorithm is useful for your project, we would love to hear about it! Also, remember to reference the paper given above in publications that make use of the AVIATOR algorithm.
